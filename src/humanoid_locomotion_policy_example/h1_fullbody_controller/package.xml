  <version>0.1.0</version>
  <description>This package implements a fullbody controller for the H1 humanoid robot using a neural network policy. 
    The policy was trained using Isaac Lab 1.2, and the autogenerated h1_env.yaml may refer to legacy components, but 
    the policy weights are compatible with current release. This package requires Pytorch 2.3.0 and higher, please refer to 
    the <a href="https://pytorch.org/get-started/previous-versions/">Pytorch website</a> for installation instructions for 
    your computer configuration.</description>
